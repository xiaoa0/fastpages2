    "This presentation taught me a lot about the educational and cross-disciplinary research opportunities available during college. I think one aspect I was concerned about even during the application process was limiting myself to one major. Although I applied for computer and data science, I discovered a love for engineering and materials science through a lab research program at SDSU. I learned that it is possible to explore computer science and its applications in different fields (physics and quantum computing). This event gave me a better sense of preparedness and I am more confident that finding more computer science opportunities in college will provide me with valuable experience and applicable skills."
