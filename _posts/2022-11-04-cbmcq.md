### 4. ![]()
I chose B instead of C because I forgot that the result of x/y would also be stored as an integer.

### 11. ![]()
I selected E because I thought that the condition for the loop continuing would be if last was positive. Now I know that the stop condition should be when last = -1 for the first if statement, so the answer would be B.

### 14. ![]()
I chose B because I forgot that the code used an arraylist and not a regular array, so I could access it directly with E.

### 25. ![]()
I selected B instead of D because the direct comparison shown in 2 threw me off and I missed the fact that 1 could be used for different boxes to compare their dimensions.

### 34. ![]()
3 doesn’t work because it tries to use x and y, but they are both private. 2 is the only correct answer because it accesses the parameters a and b.

### 38. ![]()
I selected E, but the right answer is A because it distributes the two conditions from the && operator to y > 10000 with the or gate.

### 39. ![]()
I chose E (18) because I missed the recursive part that essentially multiplies the result by ⅔. The correct answer is D.
